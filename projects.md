## Your Course Project 

Your class project is an opportunity for you to explore an interesting sequence modeling problem in the context of a real-world data set. We are providing some seed project ideas below. You can pick one of these ideas and explore the data and algorithms within and beyond what we suggest. You can also use your own data/ideas, but, in this case, you have to make sure you have the data available now and a nice roadmap, since a quarter is too short for a very open-ended and uncertain research project.

Projects can be done by you as an individual, or in teams of two students. You can discuss your ideas and approach with the instructors, but of course the final responsibility to define and execute an interesting piece of work is yours.

The final project is worth 40% of your grade, which will be split amongst four deliverables:
- A project proposal (feedback, but no grade), due on October 23rd by 11:59pm.
- A project milestone (10% of the final grade), due on November 13th by 11:59pm.
- A project poster presentation (10% of the final grade), on December 6th from 1:30-3:00pm (class time).
- A final report (20% of the final grade), due on December 11th by 11:59pm.

Your project will be evaluated by three criteria:
- Technical Depth: How technically challenging was what you did?
- Scope: How broad was your project? How many aspects, angles, variations did you explore? 
- Presentation: How well did you explain what you did, your results, and interpret the outcomes? Did you use the good graphs and visualizations? How clear was the writing?

The Technical Depth and Scope are complementary criteria, e.g., if you develop a single elaborate algorithm or model on a single dataset, you may score high on depth but low on scope, while if you try many very simple methods on different datasets, your scope would be higher but the depth lower.

To give you a sense of what we're expecting:
- A great project would involve constructing a model---one that synthesizes and goes beyond the various ideas from lecture and homework---tailored to your particular dataset with careful thought about how the model is trained and evaluated. It would involve a variety of analyses to stress test your model and justify your interpretation of the results. The presentation would clearly and concisely convey your results.  An alternative great project would consider a range of modern sequence models and/or datasets and do a thoughtful and thorough analysis of the tradeoffs between the methods, with insights as to why and when certain methods perform better than others (rather than just leaderboard competition-style numbers comparing the methods without intuition/guidance added).
- An okay project would tweak a model, algorithm, and analysis from class and apply it to a new dataset. It would involve a few different checks to show that the model is appropriate and a nice report of your findings. (A better project would consider a range of modeling or algorithmic approaches covered in class and thoroughly study which performed best, and explain why.) The presentation would get the message across.
- A subpar project would simply apply existing techniques from existing packages to a dataset and do the bare minimum to get a result.  The models and algorithms would have been covered in lectures or homeworks with the dataset considered not requiring any new insights.  It might omit key steps of model checking and model criticism or have clear conceptual errors in the model and/or algorithm formulation. The presentation might be perfunctory.

## Project Proposal  

You must turn in a project proposal on **October 23rd by 11:59pm via Gradescope**.

Read the list of available data sets and potential project ideas below. If you prefer to use a different data set, we will consider your proposal, but you must have access to this data already, and present a clear proposal for what you would do with it. 

**Project proposal format**: Proposals should be **one page maximum**. Include the following information:
- Project title
- Data set
- Project idea. This should be approximately two paragraphs.
- Software you will need to write.
- Papers to read. Include 1-3 relevant papers. If you are doing something different then one of the suggested projects, you will probably want to read at least one of them before submitting your proposal.
- Teammate: will you have a teammate? If so, whom? Maximum team size is two students. One proposal per team.
- Milestone: What will you complete by the milestone? Experimental results of some kind are expected here.

## Project Milestone  

A project milestone should be submitted on **November 13th by 11:59pm via Gradescope**. Your writeup should be 3 pages maximum in [NeurIPS format](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2023/PaperInformation/StyleFiles), not including references (the templates are for LaTex, if you want to use other editors/options please try to get close to the same format). You should describe the results of your first experiments here. Note that, as with any conference, the page limits are strict! Papers over the limit will not be considered.

## Poster Session  

We will hold a poster session on **December 6th from 1:30-3:00pm (location TBD)**. Each team will be given a stand to present a poster summarizing the project motivation, methodology, and results. The poster session will give you a chance to show off the hard work you put into your project, and to learn about the projects of your peers. 

Here are some details on the poster format:
- We will provide poster boards that are 40” (height) x 30” (wide). 
- Suggested ways to make your poster:
  - Create a bunch of presentation slides (using powerpoint, beamer, etc), and print out each side on a piece of letter-sized paper. Then, put them all together on the provided poster board.
  - If you have access to a poster printer, you are welcome to create a single huge slide and print it out on a poster printer. However, you are not expected to have access to a poster printer, and you will not receive extra "presentation points" if you use this method.

## Project Report  

Your final submission will be a project report on **Monday, December 11th at 11:59pm via Gradescope**. 
Your writeup should be 8 pages maximum in [NeurIPS format](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2023/PaperInformation/StyleFiles), not including references (the templates are for LaTex, if you want to use other editors/options please try to get close to the same format). You should describe the task you solved, your approach, the algorithms, the results, and the conclusions of your analysis. Note that, as with any conference, the page limits are strict! Papers over the limit will not be considered. 

## Project Ideas  

The course staff has outlined several potential project ideas below. This should give you a sense of the datasets available and an appropriate scope for your project. You can either pick one of these or come up with something of your own to work on.

TBD
